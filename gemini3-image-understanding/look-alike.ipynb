    "    41% - 50% (Moderate Association): Reminiscent. One major anatomical zone aligns (e.g., eyes/brows), but the rest of the face is distinct.\n",
    "    51% - 60% (Balanced Similarity): Comparable. Distinct individuals, but there is enough overlap in bone structure to suggest a relation.\n",
    "    61% - 70% (Strong Resemblance): \"Cousin\" status. Strong resemblance in the \"map\" of the face; differences are only in the details/nuance.\n",
    "    71% - 80% (Kindred Spirits): High resemblance. They share facial ratios that suggest a blood relation (e.g., parent/child or first cousins), but are clearly distinguishable as different people.\n",
    "    81% - 90% (Biological Sibling / Doppelgänger): Extremely high correlation. This tier represents biological sisters/brothers who look very similar, or unrelated high-grade lookalikes. They share almost all facial features, with only minor structural variances.\n",
