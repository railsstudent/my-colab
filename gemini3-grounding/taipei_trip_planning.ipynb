       "    *   **Action:** Buy one immediately upon arrival at TPE Airport or any MRT station. Load about 1,000 TWD to start.\n",
       "*   **Compact, Wind-Resistant Umbrella:**\n",
       "    *   **Why:** The forecast calls for rain on Nov 26-27. Taiwan rain can be sudden, and coastal winds in Taoyuan can invert cheap umbrellas.\n",
       "    *   **Recommendation:** Bring a high-quality travel umbrella. If you forget, purchase a sturdy clear vinyl umbrella at any 7-Eleven (they are surprisingly durable).\n",
       "*   **Small Plastic Bags:**\n",
       "    *   **Why:** Public trash cans are very rare in Taiwan (especially at Night Markets). You will need a place to store your sticky skewers and used napkins until you find a bin (usually at MRT stations or convenience stores).\n",
       "*   **Hand Sanitizer & Wet Wipes:**\n",
       "    *   **Why:** Essential for Night Markets (eating finger food) and because some older public restrooms may lack soap or paper towels.\n",

       "**Tops (Layers are key):**\n",

       "*   **2 Long-Sleeve Shirts:** For the cooler overcast days (Nov 26-27).\n",
       "*   **1 Mid-Layer:** A zip-up hoodie, cardigan, or fleece. This is vital for heavily air-conditioned malls/trains and the temperature drop at night.\n",
       "*   **1 Outer Layer:** A **water-resistant windbreaker** or trench coat.\n",

       "    *   **Night Markets / Street Food / Small Bubble Tea Shops:** **CASH IS KING.** They will *not* take credit cards. Carry 100 TWD and 500 TWD bills. Break 1,000 TWD bills at convenience stores; vendors hate breaking large bills for small snacks.\n",
       "    *   **Malls / Department Stores / Hotels:** Credit Cards (Visa/Mastercard) are accepted everywhere. Apple Pay is widely supported in convenience stores and MRT turnstiles (if using a credit card with foreign transaction enabled).\n",
       "*   **ATM Advice:** Use ATMs inside 7-Eleven (CTBC Bank) or FamilyMart (Taishin Bank). They work reliably with foreign cards.\n",

       "    *   **Verdict:** **If you are from the US, you do NOT need an adapter.** Your devices will plug directly into the wall.\n",

       "    *   **eSIM (Recommended):** Apps like Airalo or Holafly work perfectly in Taiwan.\n",
